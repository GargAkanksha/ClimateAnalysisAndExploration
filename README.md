# ClimateAnalysisAndExploration

In this project, climate analysis and data exploration of Hawaii climate sqlite database(Resources/hawaii.sqlite) has been conducted using Python and SQLAlchemy. Data exploration includes writing queries for precipitation analysis, most active stations anlysis, temperature analysis, rainfall per weather station and daily noramls. Once the initial analysis is complete, a Flask application has been developed that contains different routes that present the information learned through various queries.
In this project, various data analytics technologies such as Python Pandas, SqlAlchemy, Matplotlib and Flask have been used.
